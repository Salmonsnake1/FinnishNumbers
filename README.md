# Finnish Number Practice

Small personal practice project that was designed for practicing Finnish numbers and their inflections. A number is randomly generated and the user can attempt to write the correct answer. The user can also 
toggle between numeric and word form. All singular cases except instructive are avaiable for practice. The maximum range is 0 - 1000000. 

## Features
- Basic scoring and streak system
- Can switch between numeric and word - required answer switches as well.
- Customisable range
- Can switch between different cases except instructive. All cases are in the singular. 

## Potentially upcoming features
- Ordinal number practice
- Plural practice
- Timed mode 

## Known issues
- Layout issues - e.g. text version of numbers don't line up nicely.
- Responsive design is lacking.
